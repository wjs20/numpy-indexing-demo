    "The brilliant quote above from Brian Kernigan (A developer of the early unix operating system) was of course talking about the C programming language, but I think the same could equally be said about NumPy. Without proper care, its all to easy to introduce subtle bugs into NumPy code that can be a headache to debug. These bugs often revolve around improper indexing. Despite these difficulties I think NumPy is an excellant and underused tool so I thought I would provide a few tips in this article to help ensure you end up with an elegant and efficient program, not a bloody mess."

    "For those unfamiliar with NumPy, it is a python library that provides multidimensional array data structures and routines for manipulating them. These data structures and routines are implemented in highly optimized C or fortran code. This makes them very fast, and also avoids much of the memory overhead that is associated with python objects and function calls. Due to this speed and efficiency its often preferable (or even necessary) to implement heavy duty numeric computation in numpy rather than pure python. It has the added nicety that it interoperates beatifully with the rest of the python data ecosystem (pandas, matplotlib, scipy, numba). I've shown an example of some numpy code below, which computes the pairwise euclidean distance between points in 3D space."

    "We can now see the problem, we wanted to insert a unit axis just before the final x y z axis. Instead, we inserted one just after the batch axis. This is because the `array[None]` syntax will insert axis *from the left*. So `array[None]` will insert a unit axis before all other axes, `array[:,None]` will insert an axis *after* the first axis, etc. In our code, the `array[:,None]` inserted a unit axis *after the first axis* rather then *before the final axis*, which is what we wanted. What we want to do, is insert a unit axis *before* the final axis. We can do you using the ... notation, i.e. `array[...,None]`. What this does is make numpy insert unit axes *from the right* rather than the left. So `array[...,None]` would produce an array of shape N x 1, with N being the original shape of the array, as opposed to 1 x N. We can alter it so that it inserts a unit axis just before the final axis like so."

    "By thinking ahead of time about how the shape of your data may change, you can write code to anticipate these changes, speeding up your development cycle and avoiding nasty bugs. A key trick is to think about whether your axes indices are invariant from the right or the left. i.e if I insert a dimension I plan to introduce later, will the index of this axis change? Will it also change if I index it from the opposite end? i.e. `array[-1]` instead of `array[2]`. Broadcasting is the killer feature of NumPy, which will allow you to write faster more efficient code, but it should be treated with respect. If you find you struggle with this, don't worry; its complicated! My recommendation is, find a toy problem, fire up a jupyter notebook and mess around with some arrays.\n",
